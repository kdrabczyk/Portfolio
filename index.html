            <p class="wrapper"><span class="span-animation">Do you have this overwhelming feeling that you need to know how something works? Anyway I have... and I've always had it. It's what really keeps me going. Society, state, people and of course technology. This treat of mine took me on a long voyage throught the law studies and bar exams, and after years of hard work I've succeded, but then I realised that I can eventually focus on new technologies, so I came back to computer science- my old passion. It got me so involved that I started computer science engineering studies. I love to learn about new technologies and I love to get things done.</span></p>

            <p class="wrapper"><span class="span-animation">I realised I need to know more, because I really like coding, solving problems, understanding new technologies. I like to see things in a broader perspective, this is what brought me to the undergraduate computer science engineering studies. My course includes programming, algorithms and data structures, computer architecture, operating systems, computer networks, parallel
            computing, embedded systems, algorithms design, circuit analysis and electronics, digital logic and processor design,
            computer graphics, scientific computing, software engineering, database systems, digital signal processing,
            virtualization, computer simulations. I just can't wait to learn and understand all those matters.</span></p>

            <p class="wrapper"><span class="span-animation">I've started learning coding 4 years ago, only to try to figure out how things work. I've started with a small Java app
            and got throught a few tutorials. During this time I've learned to understand some basics of programming and the main concepts. After
            that it started to amused me how my friends treated programming like some kind of a sorcery. Then I've had a long break, but meanwhile I realised
            that I needed to know what a Web App really is and how it is created, so I did. I took some tutorials on HTML, CSS, Javascript,
            Postgress, Python Django and then I got throught some project tutorials and finally I've focused on front-end web
            development and started coding my own projects. Right now I really want to learn the basics and excel my skills.</span></p>
